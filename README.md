### Hi there 👋, my name is Ramon Becker.
I like ☕ and readings 📚, but I really like to develop 💻. I hope I can contribute to you and our community :call_me_hand:. 

- 👨‍🎓 I am currently majoring in Systems Analysis and Development at the Federal Institute of Santa Catarina (IFSC). 
- 💻 I am currently learning about development with the Django Framework.
- 👨‍💻 I want to learn more about TypeScript, React, Angular and also frameworks for Java like: Spring and Hibernat (Although I have already developed some projects with this framework).
